Powers down all connected nodes or all specified NODES.

    node-control poweroff [help] [-y] [NODES]

NODES can be a list of IP addresses of all the nodes that shall be shutdown. If
omitted, all configured nodes are shutdown.

If all master nodes are shutdown, DC/OS is likely not to work any more. In this
case a reinstall is needed ('node-control reinstall').

help
    Displays this help. Other arguments are rendered meaningless.

-y, --yes
    Don't ask for confirmation, just poweroff.
